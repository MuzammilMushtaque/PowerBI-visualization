# PowerBI Visualization

This repository focuses on creating Power BI dashboards using two distinct datasets.

1) **Call Center Dashboard:** This dashboard provides a visual representation of the performance of call center employees over different time periods, including hours and days.

2) **Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard:** This dashboard analyzes the root causes of slow progress within a company over time. It primarily explores factors such as the gender ratio within the company and employee terminations.

Feel free to explore these dashboards and consider enhancing them for a more illustrative and insightful presentation. Your contributions are welcome for further improvements.
